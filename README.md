# Hyperspectral Image classification - identification of resources in a HSI file 

A project to classify landmarks/natural resources in a HSI file and train a deep convolutional neural network with the extracted features.

**Usage**

The code is written in python. So recommended following:
1. Python3
2. Certain libraries - Scikit, numpy, matplolib, PIL OR just download anaconda 4 :)
3. Spectral python [Spy](http://www.spectralpython.net/installation.html)
4. wxPython [Download](https://wxpython.org/)

**Current implementation**

Currently the code only visualizes the HSI files and generates the graphs for any pixel in an image
