#Cancer detection using neural networks and Hyperspectral imaging

A project to detect cancer in the early stages of their development so as to reduce the number of deaths due to cancer.

#Usage

The code is written in python. So recommended following:
1. Python3
2. Certain libraries - Scikit, numpy, matplolib, PIL OR just download anaconda 4 :)

#Current implementation

Currently the code only generates the graphs for cancerous and non cancerous regions. Features from the graph need to be extracted to 
train the neural network model
