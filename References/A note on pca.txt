When to use PCA?

you don’t need to reduce the dimensions, if you are just predicting or classifying.
However, if you are taking decision on the basis of relationships between variables, 
you should do a PCA.

The only scenario when you can leave PCA out is when you don’t see multi-collinearity / correlations 
in your variables.

However, if you do see a strong or even moderate correlation between variables, 
PCA is highly suggested
usual purpose of PCA is dimensionality reduction, i.e. describing relationships in your data using 
fewer dimensions than are actually present.
A component that explains a lot of variance could be a good feature but not necessarily, its not
 exactly geared towards that purpose.

What is the difference between principal component analysis (PCA) and feature selection in machine 
learning?

Both methods reduce dimensionality (# of predictors).

PCA combines similar (correlated) attributes and creates new ones. Superior to original attributes.

Feature selection doesn’t combine attributes. Just evaluates their quality, predictive power and 
select the best set.
